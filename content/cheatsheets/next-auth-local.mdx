IMPORTANT: While writing this cheat sheet I am using "next-auth": "^4.22.1", "@next-auth/prisma-adapter": "^1.0.6", "@prisma/client": "^4.13.0", "bcrypt": "^5.1.0", "next": "13.4.1", "prisma": "^4.13.0", "axios": "^1.3.6", and "@types/bcrypt": "^5.0.0".

</Callout>

<Callout>

IMPORTANT: This cheat-sheet is based on CodewithAntonio's [Messenger Clone video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPGcKBpAk8&t=4874s). But it should work on any application where you are using NextJS, next-auth and Prisma.

</Callout>

## What is covered in this article?

In a Next.js 13 application using Prisma and next-auth for local development. We will be following the stable and recommended app directory structure provided by Next.js. There are two ways we will be using next-auth:

1. Using credentials, specifically email and password for authentication.
2. Implementing social login functionality with Google and Github.

## Getting Started

This cheat sheet focuses on the setup process only. Assuming you have completed the API part, make sure your collection is in the database before installing next-auth. Once you have confirmed its presence, you can proceed with the following steps.

If you are having trouble in setting up the api check and stuff check the complete guide [Next-auth with NextJs 13.](https://faq-codewithantonio.vercel.app/guides/using-next-auth-next-13)

## Run the following command

```html
npm install next-auth@latest @prisma/client @next-auth/prisma-adapter bcrypt
```

Version specific command:

```bash
npm install next-auth@4.22.1 @prisma/client@4.13.0 @next-auth/prisma-adapter@1.0.6 bcrypt@5.0.0 axios@1.3.6
```

## Setting up the Environment variables

Go to your .env file write the following

```.env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
GITHUB_ID=
GITHUB_SECRET=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

While writing the api routes, if you changed the name of the environment variable write that.

> Double check for typo, it is a very common problem.

## Setting the value for NEXTAUTH_SECRET

For NEXTAUTH_SECRET you can put any string.

### Functionality:

For the code for onSubmit handler in AuthForm.tsx , follow the video or check Antonio's repo.

<Callout>
  Verification: Go to your auth form in the browser and register a new user. If
  everything is working properly a new user should be created in your database.
</Callout>

## Creating Login functionality

For login we have to call signIn function from next-auth. Also to log-in we have the option to use credentials or Social log-in i.e. Google and Github.

We have 3 providers to choose from (Credentials, Google and Github) since we wrote all the 3 in your [...nextauth]/route.ts

### Login with Credentials

Follow the video for the code.

We call the signIn function from next-auth inside the onSubmit handler. We pass 2 argument to the signIn function. First is the authentication method, which in this case is "credentials" and the second argument is an object that spreads the properties of the data object.

## Social Login with Github

### Github Environment Variables

Before continuing with social login we will need to have the secret keys. For github

Go to your github account --> settings --> Developer settings --> Oauth Apps

Then create a new app by clicking on "New OAuth App"

A should see an application form. On "Homepage URL" and "Authorization callback URL" field put http://localhost:3000/

> I are using http://localhost:3000/ since that's where my server is running.

/>

<Callout>
  Make sure it is "http" in the both url. Using "https" might cause errors.
</Callout>

Click on "Register application".

### GITHUB_ID

Now you should see the Client Id, copy that code and put it in your .env file. This is the value for "GITHUB_ID".

### GITHUB_SECRET

Below the Client ID there is a button called "Generate a new client secret". Click on it, a key should generate. Copy the code and paste it as the value for GITHUB_SECRET.

### Functionality for Github Login.

Follow the video and write the code for socialAction. Video: [1:49:30](<(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPGcKBpAk8&t=4874s)>)

### Verification for Github Login functionality

Try to login by clicking on the github button. Then go to your database --> Account Collection and you should see the github account you tried to login with.

<Callout>

Common Problem: Your github account might only be in Account collection and not in User Collection.

Expected Outcome: Once you Login with Github, account information should be in both Account and User collection.

Solution: To solve this problem, delete all the accounts from User and Account collection. Then try to login with Github again. If it is successful you should see the account information in both Account and User.

</Callout>

Once you get the expected outcome, you should be done with this part. If you have more questions ask in the discord.

## Social Login with Google

### Google Environment Variables

Before continuing with Google login we will need to have the secret keys. For google

1. Go to your [google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) --> Create a new project --> Name the project and click Create.

Your project should be created and a Dashboard should appear.

2. Click on APIs & Services

3. We need to set up the 'OAuth Consent screen". So click on OAuth concent screen which should be visible on the left side of the screen. Then choose External and click on the Create button.

A registration from should appear. Provide your desired name for the application and developer's email.

Then click on Save and continue. It is a 4 step registration process, you can leave the rest of the steps exactly like the way it is and just keep on clicking "Save and Continue"

Then Click on "Credential" (left side of screen) --> "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" --> "OAuth-client ID" --> Application Type: Web Application --> Add Authorized redirect URIs i.e. http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google --> Create

<Callout>
  Make sure it is "http" in the both url. Using "https" might cause errors.
