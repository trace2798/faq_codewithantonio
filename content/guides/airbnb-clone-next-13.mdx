Hello I would like to solve some common problems here which you might face.

## Version for this project.

Due to constant changes and development, make sure you are using the same version of dependencies that has as been used in the video. This are the dependencies version from package.json from Antonio's repository.

```javascript
  "dependencies": {
    "@next-auth/prisma-adapter": "^1.0.5",
    "@prisma/client": "^4.11.0",
    "@types/node": "18.15.5",
    "@types/react": "18.0.28",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.0.11",
    "axios": "^1.3.4",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.0",
    "date-fns": "^2.29.3",
    "eslint": "8.36.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "13.2.4",
    "leaflet": "^1.9.3",
    "next": "13.2.4",
    "next-auth": "^4.20.1",
    "next-cloudinary": "^4.0.1",
    "next-superjson-plugin": "^0.5.6",
    "query-string": "^8.1.0",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-date-range": "^1.4.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "react-hook-form": "^7.43.7",
    "react-hot-toast": "^2.4.0",
    "react-icons": "^4.8.0",
    "react-leaflet": "^4.2.1",
    "react-select": "^5.7.2",
    "react-spinners": "^0.13.8",
    "swr": "^2.1.1",
    "typescript": "5.0.2",
    "world-countries": "^4.0.0",
    "zustand": "^4.3.6"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/bcrypt": "^5.0.0",
    "@types/leaflet": "^1.9.3",
    "@types/react-date-range": "^1.4.4",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
    "postcss": "^8.4.21",
    "prisma": "^4.11.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.2.7"
  }
}
```

## Error: World-countries doesn't show flags
Happens on Chrome and Firefox. A workaround is to use a package called "react-country-flag" and code in CountrySelect.tsx

 ```bash
npm install react-country-flag@3.1.0
```

Location: app/components/inputs/CountrySelect.tsx
```javascript
import CountryFlag from 'react-country-flag';
...
<div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-3">
  <ReactCountryFlag
    className="w-[1em] h-[1em]"
    countryCode={option.value}
    svg
    aria-label={option.label}
  />
 ...
```
