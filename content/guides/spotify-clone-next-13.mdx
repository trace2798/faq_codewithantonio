## Supabase login error

```javascript
You can generate an access token from https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens
Enter your access token: 
Error: Invalid access token format. Must be like `sbp_0102...1920`.
Try rerunning the command with --debug to troubleshoot the error.
```
Solution: You can try "ctrl+shift+v" if even that does not work you just need to write the access code manually.
