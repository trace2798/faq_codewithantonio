## Error: The Provided database string is invalid

You might be missing the '/test' in the db url. MongoDB make some changes which happened after the video was recorded, previously would should just copy the whole string from their website but now '/test' part is missing.
If you have the "test" and still getting the error check your password. Also from their recent change wwe have to use a strong password previously we would use anything and there were no checks.

Your final string should look like something like this:

```html
mongodb+srv://project:bvhacvhgvs2455@cluster0.zwccdhb.mongodb.net/test
```

## Error: Prisma Error

Most of the time this error occurs when you forget to run the prisma commands.

After setting up the schema.prisma make sure you run

```bash
npm prisma db push
```

### To Verify push was successful

To verify that the above command worked successfully. Go to you database and check your collection it should look like this.

<Image
  src="/images/guides/collectionDb.jpg"
  width="300"
  height="300"
  alt="Image"
/>

### Not seeing anything in your collection?

If you initialed "npm prisma db push" and still not seeing anything on your collection?

You probably forgot to save the schema.prisma file before initiating the command.

## next-superjson-plugin related error

Error: failed to process failed to invoke plugin.

This plugin is not working with the latest version of NextJs. Quick fix is to use the same version of NextJS/dependencies that has been used in the video.

## Pusher Related Error

### Error: PusherRequestError

message: Unexpected status code 400

This might happen if you have a wrong cluster in your pusher.ts file. In the video Antonio's cluster is 'eu' so he uses that. To check your cluster, go to your pusher dashboard and click on App Keys, it will be mentioned there.

## next-auth related question

I made a whole guide for [next-auth](https://faq-codewithantonio.vercel.app/guides/using-next-auth-next-13). That guide should guide your through anything related to it. If you still have questions feel free to ask in the discord server.

You can find cheat sheets in this link [Cheat Sheets](https://faq-codewithantonio.vercel.app/cheatsheets). The cheat sheet might help you to debug some common problems.
